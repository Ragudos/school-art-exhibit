When we were younger, the only way we could release our urge to beat people and socialize was by going outside. We met new friends and had fun, didn't we? And those times were more tranquil and it gave you a peace of mind since technology like smartphones and social media didn't exist then. The artwork shows some of the games that one would usually play during their childhood to pass their time like tumbang preso, taya-tayaan (a game of tag), luksong baka, and many more.

The silence comes along as the sun hides under the Earth, leaving nothing but darkness. In the midst of chirping insects and hooting owls, stood a decrepit and scary-looking woman hungry for babies.

With each crunch, a part of her hip is separated from her torso.

Ever-so-slowly, she pulled them apart and her insides quickly got pulled by gravity, leaving them hanging like clothes being dried out in the sun.

She flew off into the dark moonlit sky with her bat-like wings spread open, and laughed eerily as to hint the nearby families that it's time for her to hunt. For babies!

Most of the Filipino children fear this mythological creature.

It's a vampire-like lady that detaches their lower half in order to fly and hunt babies and children which is why it is feared among children.

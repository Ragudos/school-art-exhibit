Do you remember the time when you visited a park back when innocence still hadn't been taken away? If you do, then you must feel a sense of familiarity with this image. This photo was taken inside Circle of Fun in Quezon Memorial Circle. If you live near Quezon City, you have probably toured this main national park of Quezon City when you were still young. Besides its 66 meters tall mausoleum, you can enjoy slides, seesaws, tube slides and swings inside Circle of Fun for free while having a picnic. Is nostalgia overwhelming you at the moment? Think back to the days when you could afford to rent a bike for an hour to go around? It even has that mountain-like steep road where you need to use your biking skills to get over. On top of that, this picture reminds us how fortunate we were as children to had been there. Despite how decrepit the place looks now since many years have passed, children of this generation are still experiencing such innocent, happy, and wonderful bliss in their own worlds.

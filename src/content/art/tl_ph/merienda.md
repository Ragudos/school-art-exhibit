When we talk about food during childhood, how could we not remember the merienda that our mothers used to prepare for us in the afternoon? Or perhaps the food we buy from the street vendors that pass our homes? Merienda has been a big part of our life growing up since most of the time we sit, eat, and talk to not just our family, but our friends too while eating indoors or outdoors.

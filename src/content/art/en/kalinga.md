In the Filipino language, Kalinga means protecting and caring for someone.

A Filipino mother and a child are both represented in this work of art as they display affection and protectiveness toward each other.

Seeing this artwork might remind you of the times when they would wait patiently for you to come home and took care of you through physical touch and verbal and emotional affirmation.

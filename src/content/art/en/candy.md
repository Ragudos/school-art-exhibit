This shelf of toothsome candies in Divisoria we used to eat as a child reminds us of the deciduous or baby teeth we lost due to our parents' insistence that we always eat sweets.

Some popular candies on this shelf are Stick-O, Frutos, Pintoora, Pochi, Flat Tops, Champi, and Haw Haw Milk Candy.

But honestly, in the colorful array before us, these childhood snacks and candies were what attracted our hungry little eyes, which resulted to our adorable little smiles.

Piko is one of the well-known childhood games played by Filipinos.

A pattern of boxes is drawn on a concrete floor using chalk or a soft stone to play this game.

The pamato used by players is a stone that they toss into a box before skipping forward and backward. They will keep doing this until they finish the level or get the boxes as their own/bahay.",

From the words of Ms. Salcedo:

â€œWe were waiting for the rain to stop inside the UP Diliman campus and heard three clever little boys playing at the back of the waiting shed. Having been in this situation myself as a child, it did not matter if the river had a speck of impure dirt on it while we were swimming and playing. The sight of them brightened my day, and I thought it would be nice to ask them for a picture as I suddenly recalled every little moment we had on a river with my cousins back when we were still young."

From the words of Mr. Ygar, M.:

"A 'duyan,' or swing, served as my favorite spot when I was younger. My parents and I spend the most of our time here. I remember giggling as they swung me up high as the wind brushes my skin. A sentimental moment to remember. That's why a 'duyan' has always been my favorite spot to visit when I want to reminisce about my youth."

Memories: A horrifying thing yet this can also be a life-saver. The moments when you'd feel at your lowest point is when your past comes to life. You are reminded of the good things, and this makes you hold on tight even onto the thinnest and weakest thread as much as you can, for as long as you have to.

You hold on. Until the time that your thread becomes strong and mighty once again. Make good memories, and with this, you will always have something to look at whenever you'd feel down. Look forward in creating something better and more memorable for the future you to thank you for. This artwork is called Anamnesis which basically means 'the remembering of things from a supposed previous existence.

A protrait of a woman was drawn by the artist and inside her head are all the things that made her childhood something worth to remember. This art is all about reminiscing the past memories that made her life joyous and carefree.

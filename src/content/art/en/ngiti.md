From the words of Ms. Salcedo: “I got used to the fact that there are always children playing in front of our house but the moment I took this picture, two adorable little neighbor girls were just watching me key unlock the door as I got home from school on November 23, 2022. They caught my eye for their matching purple headbands, and cute dresses, and we chatted for a bit, asked their names, how old they were, and what color they liked. I was lifted up by the chit-chat we had, recalling how I used to think the world was just about playing, colors, laughter, offering undivided attention, and learning something new from every new experience.”

The most prominent in Filipino culture is the value of respect.

Honorary is a piece of art that depicts young people showing respect and honor to elderly people with the 'Pagmamano' act. It specifically refers to Filipinos who have carried on this practice since they were children.

Old people are usually respected because they are known to have more experiences as they are much older, and because of this, they have more insight in life that can help a young person prosper if he were to have these insights/pieces of knowledge.
